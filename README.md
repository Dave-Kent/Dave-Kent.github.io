I am a retired engineer and I am filling my idle time by learning a little about computer science.
In recent years I studied CS50x online (which I would totally recommnend to someone in my situation) and I am currently learning about CSS.
This project is a family website documenting the history of our family since Victorian times.
This will show me.
