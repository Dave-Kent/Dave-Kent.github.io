          <p>
            The picture taken in 1923 shows seven-year-old twins Phyllis and
            Joan West outside their grandmother, Martha Smith’s, shop in East
            Twerton. Their other grandmother, Emma West, with their grandfather,
            Walter, lived in Stuart Place, less than 220 yards away.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, Charles Kent lived just around the corner from
            Stuart place and that was just a few doors from his grandparents,
            George and Mary Kent. In 1941 Joan and Charles were married.
          </p>
          <p>
            East Twerton was a small community built around St Peter's Church
            and school and very close to the huge engineering works of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stothert_%26_Pitt"
              >Stothert &#38; Pitt</a>, for many years the largest employer in 
            the area, where Joan and Phyllis’ father, Herbert Walter West, 
            worked as a machinist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Herbert came from a large East Twerton family. He and two of his
            brothers were notable sportsmen, all playing rugby for the Bath
            Football Club. His brother Thomas, after captaining the local side
            in 1908, moved to Lancashire to play for the Rochdale Hornets, then
            one of the most successful teams in the country. In 1915, early in
            the first world war, Thomas was serving in the King’s Royal Rifle
            Corps and was killed in action.
