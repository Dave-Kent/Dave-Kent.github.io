            This picture, taken in 1923, shows seven-year-old twins Phyllis and
            Joan West outside their grandmother, Martha Smith’s, shop in 
            <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/7g6bjHdnuTyhba5V9">South View Road,</a> 
            East Twerton. Their other grandmother, Emma West, with
            their grandfather, Walter, lived in Stuart Place, less than 200
            metres away.

            At the same time, Charles Kent lived with his parents Albert and Mary
             just around the corner from
            Stuart Place and that was just a few doors from his grandparents,
            George and Mary Kent.</p>

          <p>In 1941 Joan and Charles were married.

            East Twerton was a small community built around St Peter's Church
            and School and very close to the huge engineering works of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stothert_%26_Pitt"
              >Stothert &#38; Pitt</a
            >, for many years the largest employer in the area, where Joan and
            Phyllis’ father, Herbert Walter West, worked as a machinist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Herbert came from a large East Twerton family. He and two of his
            brothers were notable sportsmen, all playing rugby for the

            His brother Thomas, after captaining the local side in 1908, moved
            to Lancashire to play for the

              >Rochdale Hornets</a
            >, then, one of the most successful teams in the country. In 1915,
            early in the first world war, Thomas was serving in the King’s Royal
            Rifle Corps and was killed in action.
