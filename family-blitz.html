          <p>
            At the start of the second world war in 1939, Albert and Mary Kent
            and their son Charles had moved to 
            <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/bnG9vNG6s69wPod5A">169 Englishcombe Lane</a>. 
            The property
            (the rear shown above, with Charles standing in front) 
            was a semi detached cottage on the edge of farmland, just over a
            mile from East Twerton.</p>
            <p> In April 1942, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_Blitz">Bath was attacked</a> 
            by the German luftwaffe air force as part of the so-called 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baedeker_Blitz">"Baedeker
            raids"</a> . 1100 buildings were seriously damaged or destroyed, 417
            people were killed and 1000 injured. In the early morning of Monday
            27th April 1942, the Kent's building was struck. The adjacent
            house took a direct hit, and resident Frederick Brewer, a young
            man almost the same age as Charles, was killed. No-one in the Kent
            family was seriously hurt but their home had to be demolished so
            Albert and Mary were made homeless. For some time, they lived in a
            large wooden shed in the garden (shown below, with Mary and Albert),
             until the house could be rebuilt.
            Charles and Joan had married the previous year, so they stayed at
            the West family home, then in Lyncombe Hill moving to Englishcombe
            Lane a few years later, when they already had two young sons.
