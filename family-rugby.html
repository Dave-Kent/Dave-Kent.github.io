            <a href="./family-tree.html?family=6">Walter and Emma West</a> had nine
            children, six of them were boys, three of them were very successful
            on the rugby field. Herbert was six years older than Thomas, and
            eighteen years older than Reginald. All the boys played at the same
            position, scrum-half, but Tom also played at outside-half (alongside
            Herbert in a few first team games for Bath) and, for the major part
            of his career, at wing three-quarter. Herbert sustained an eye
            injury, which probably limited his career, but Thomas played ninety
            games for Bath, including a season as captain of the club before
            moving to Lancashire to play for 
            <a href="http://rochdalerlheritage.blogspot.com/p/page-5.html">
            Rochdale Hornets</a>, where players
            received payment for playing.</p>

            <p> The next generation, grandsons of
            Walter and Emma, were also involved in the local rugby clubs. Cyril
            (Bud) West was a very successful full-back, though his playing
            career for Bath was interrupted by military service in the second
            world war. Charles (Joe) Kent, who had been at school with Bud, and
            Ken Sherriff, who married Phyllis West, also played for the club.</p>

            <p>
                Until 1995, rugby union was an exclusively amateur game, so that
                players for local teams would be men living locally to the clubs
                and, most often, men who had learned the game together at local
                schools. This made the sport, and its clubs, a particularly strong
                element of many local communities.
