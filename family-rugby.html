            <a href="./family-tree.html?family=6">Walter and Emma West</a> had nine
            children, six of them were boys, three of them were very successful
            on the rugby field. Herbert was six years older than 
            <a href="#tom-west">Thomas</a>, and
            eighteen years older than Reginald. All the boys played at the same
            position, scrum-half, but Tom also played at outside-half (alongside
            Herbert in a few first team games for Bath) and, for the major part
            of his career, at wing three-quarter. Herbert sustained an eye
            injury, which probably limited his career, but <a href="#tom-west">Thomas</a> 
            played ninety first team games for Bath Football Club, including a 
            season as captain of the club. </p>

            <p> The next generation, grandsons of
            Walter and Emma, were also involved in the local rugby clubs. Cyril
            (Bud) West was a very successful full-back, though his playing
            career for Bath was interrupted by military service in the second
            world war. Buds cousins Arthur and Edward also played for the club
            as did in-laws Charles (Joe) Kent, who had been at school with Bud, 
            and Ken Sherriff, who married Phyllis West.</p>

            <p>
                Until 1995, rugby union was an exclusively amateur game, so that
                players for local teams would be men living locally to the clubs
                and, most often, men who had learned the game together at local
                schools. This made the sport, and its clubs, a particularly strong
                element of many local communities.

          <h2>Tom West</h2>
          <p>Tom started playing for the Bath Football Club first XV in 1903 when he was twenty years old. He was an extremely fast runner, 
            having ‘won several prizes on the running track’. At that time the fortunes of the Bath team were patchy, they were often unable 
            to field a full team. Many players would come to a Saturday match from working that morning and for away games they would rely 
            on public transport, match reports show that players were delayed by missed trains on several occasions. However, it is clear 
            from these reports that Tom was an outstanding player, playing half-back and three-quarter positions.</p>

          <p>Towards the end of the 1906/07 season he was working in Gloucester and turned out for the local side. The report in the 
            local newspaper (the Gloucester Citizen) of his first game read:
            <blockquote cite=”https://d2eq6t2r9q1quu.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/19070330-Glos.-v-Percy-Park-Bream-v-Glos.-A.pdf”>
          West. the ex-Bath three-quarter (who is working in Gloucester) made a highly satisfactory debut in the City ranks. Such a game was 
          not a severe test, but West showed pace and cleverness in attack, and had the distinction of scoring four tries.</blockquote></p>
          <p>He finished that season at Gloucester but returned to the Bath club the following season and was made captain. Results for that 
            season were disappointing and then, at the start of the 1908/09 season he played just three games before moving to Lancashire to play 
            for the very successful <a href="https://rochdalerlheritage.blogspot.com/p/page-5.html">Rochdale Hornets</a> club.</p>
          <p>Rochdale Hornets was a founding member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rugby_league#:~:text=Northern%Rugby%Football%Union">
            Northern Rugby Union</a> (predecessor of the Rugby League), formed only thirteen years previously. 
            The Northern Union allowed payments to players for time missed from work, meaning that players like Tom could take their 
            sport more seriously.</p>
